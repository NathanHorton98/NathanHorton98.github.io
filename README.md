This was a project for my undergraduate capstone course for business data anlytics. Moneyball inspired me to look into baseball statisics.
This project specifically uses analytical methods to determine which stats for offense and defense lead to a correlation of more/less wins/losses.
There were steps done in python, excel, and orange for the predictive modeling.
